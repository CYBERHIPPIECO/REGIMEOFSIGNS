New: the despot ( The Icon ) is an abstract that reigns over signs. How do you defeat the abstract?

All signs are masks of meaning.

"The body of a Despot or god has something like a counterbody: the body of the tortured or better of the excluded. There is no question that these two bodies can communicate, for the body of the despot is sometimes subjected to trials of humiliation or even torture, or of exile and exclusion." - despot being exiled from the realm of signs by the player.

You are the sign and signifier. Create a signal.

It could be said that this regime develops a kind of 'wall' on which signs are inscribed, in relation to one another and in relation to the signifier.' p. 133
